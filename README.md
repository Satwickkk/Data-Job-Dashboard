# 📊 Data Jobs Dashboard – Power BI Project

This project is an interactive **Power BI dashboard** built using a dataset of global data-related job postings.  
It highlights job demand, salary insights, job distribution, and includes **drill-through analysis** for deeper exploration of each job role.

## 🚀 Project Overview

The dashboard visually answers important questions such as:

- Which data roles are most in demand?
- What are the median yearly and hourly salaries?
- How do job counts change over time?
- How do different job titles compare (Data Analyst, Data Scientist, Data Engineer, etc.)?
- Which platforms list the most jobs?
- What percentage of jobs allow remote work?
- What locations have the highest job density?

The report consists of **two pages**:
1. **Main Dashboard** – Job trends, salaries, top job titles, and comparison metrics.
